They give the effective areas that were in place for the V2 realtime event selection, in operation since June 2019.

The alert stream consists of three separate selections, HESE, EHE and GFU. EHE and GFU are through-going muon 
selections, and have a non-trivial overlap. HESE are strating tracks, and the overlap with EHE+GFU is small. 

The selections are combined, and only unified ICECUBE_ASTROTRACK alerts are released. These are separated into GOLD, and BRONZE, which have mean signalness of 50% and 30% respectively.
 The signalness  is defined as the probability of a given event being astrophysical, rather than arising frrom atmospheric background, under the assumption of an E^-2.19 spectrum.
